**What is The Lifetime Value of Your Customers?**

# Introduction
Customer lifetime value (CLV), a term sometimes used interchangeably with customer lifetime value, is the prediction of a company's net profit contributed to its overall future relationship with a customer. The model can be simple or sophisticated, depending on how complex the predictive analytics techniques are.

Lifetime value is a critical metric because it represents the maximum amount that customers may be expected to spend in order to acquire new ones. As a result, it's crucial in determining the payback of marketing expenses used in marketing mix modeling.

# Business Problem

An e-commerce company wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. For example, it is desired to organize different campaigns for new customers and different campaigns in order to retain customers that are very profitable for the company.

# Definition of CLTV
The present value of the future cash flows attributed to the customer during his/her entire relationship with the company.!

This account represents a single time period. It represents the time when the analysis was done. Let me give such a projection that we can evaluate the issue with 3-month and 6-month projections.

How can I make my inference? We will realize lifetime value with medium and long-term projections for individuals by including the specific pattern of the whole population, by extracting the conditional probability distribution, and generalizing them in terms of the characteristics of a particular individual.

# Formula
Probabilistic lifetime value estimation with time projection

CLTV =( Customer Value / Churn Rate) * Profit Margin

Customer Value = Purchase Frequency * Average Order Value

CLTV = Expected Number of Transaction * Expected Average Profit

Above, purchase frequency and number of transaction mean the same thing. Likewise, Average Order Value and Average Profit mean the same thing. It differs with the Expected part that happens to them.

# CAUTION: 
It will add a probabilistic distribution. Expected statement refers to this part. Expected number of purchases, expected profitability.

BG / NBD = Expected Transaction
Gamma Gamma = Expected Profit

# So How Do We Do That?
We will add statistics and probability pattern to the above formula. There will be BG / NBD and Gamma Gamma models that will make this happen to us. These models will do such a thing that they will model the purchasing behavior of all customers of this company, after modeling the purchasing behavior of all customers, they will replace the individual's personal characteristics in this model and reduce the expected number of sales to the person from the general audience pattern.

BG NBD and Gamma Gamma models are statistical models, not machine learning models. In fact, these models have the expression "Conditional" at the beginning.
